                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>White Water Rafting Company was started way back in 1950. The company started with two motorboats and only five employees. As the entertainment needs started advancing, the company decided to start the rafting site works in a river, which was by then man-made. We offered our services in the man-made river for 20 years, then started thinking of an experience in a vast natural water system. After three years of pondering, the company decided to settle for an ocean as a place to have an experience in rafting. To accomplish this, we trained our 200-team employees in various skills involving diving, wading, and water racing. We have by now established a team that has all that one needs to enjoy their water experience</p>
