            <p>Hello, my name is Kevin Ogutu and I am from Mombasa, Kenya. I enjoy watching football and reading inspirational novels. Most of my hiking time I spend at the beach with my dog. I am currently pursuing Software Development at BYU-IDAHO. Before my admission to the University, I served my mission in Uganda where I interacted with different cultures, it is interesting how cultures are diverse and different across the world. One interesting thing about Kenya that only Kenyans know is that there has been serious political differences and fight for power. Something I keep telling people is that leaders are chosen by God, and until the right leader shows up, people will continue suffering under the tyrany of bad leaders.</p>
